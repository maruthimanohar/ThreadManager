 Thread Managing class
 ---------------------
 An instance of this class will create a new thread and will start its execution.
 The class takes the function pointer and variable arguments that needs to be
 passed to the new created thread.

 How to compile
 --------------
 make

To run the test cases:
--------------------
./test1
./test2


 Assumptions:
 -----------
 1. The created thread will get all the arguments in an void * array.
 2. The arguments passed by the parent thread will stored by allocating memory
 and pointers to this newly allocated memory will be passed to the child.
 3. so for example, if the parent thread passes arguments like
  (int, char, struct st, int *)
  we will allocate memory to all the variables passed and
  pass an array of pointers to the child thread.
  the child thread need to do an extra level of derefernce.
  so child will get arguments like (int *, char *, struct st*, int **).
